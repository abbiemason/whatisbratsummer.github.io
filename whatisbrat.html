        <p id="inline-paragraph" >Brat was met with widespread acclaim from critics. Commercially, it debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and reached the top ten in 12 additional countries, including the United States, where it debuted at number three, Charli XCX's highest debut. According to Metacritic, it is the highest rated album of 2024 and the 16th-highest-rated album of all time as of August 2024. The album was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize for 2024 album of the year.
            The cover art and aesthetic became a popular Internet trend, and was adopted by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 presidential campaign after Charli XCX tweeted about the candidate.Brat is Charli XCX's sixth studio album and first after renewing her contract with Atlantic Records in early 2023. It was announced on 28 February 2024, a day before the release of the lead single "Von Dutch".
            According to Charli XCX, Brat is her "most aggressive and confrontational record", but also her most vulnerable. On 22 February, during her Boiler Room warehouse set, she debuted snippets of tracks identified as "Spring Breakers" and "365".She was joined onstage by Addison Rae and Julia Fox; a "Von Dutch" remix with Rae and A. G. Cook was released on 22 March. On 6 March, she premiered "So I" at the Billboard Women in Music event"Club Classics" and "B2B" were released on 3 April as a two-pack promotional single. After teasing the song for a few days, on 29 April, Charli announced the release of the next single, "360". It was released on 10 May alongside its music video, which was teased earlier that day, and was described by her as her "best music video ever". The video features multiple "it girls",including Gabbriette, Chloë Sevigny, Julia Fox, and Rachel Sennott. A remix of "360" soon followed, featuring Swedish artists Robyn and Yung Lean, which was released on 31 May.During her 1 June headlining set at Barcelona's Primavera Sound festival, she debuted two unreleased songs live, "365" and "Everything is Romantic". Brat was released on 7 June 2024. A deluxe edition, titled Brat and It's the Same but There's Three More Songs So It's Not, was released on 10 June, containing three additional songs. On 21 June, a remix version of "Girl, So Confusing" featuring New Zealand singer Lorde was released. On 1 August 2024, a remix version of "Guess" from the deluxe edition was released featuring singer Billie Eilish. The following day, "Apple" was released to Italian radio as the album's third single. On 12 September, a "Talk Talk" remix featuring Troye Sivan was released along with the announcement of a remix album titled Brat and It's Completely Different but Also Still Brat scheduled for 11 October 2024.  </p>
